            During our visit to the CMA-CGM building in Marseille, we learned about what the shipping company does on a day-to-day basis, along with their interest in the environment and goals for developing more efficient, eco-friendly transportation. The speakers also shared CMA-CGM's history and their inclusion in major events such as the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. Beginning as a humble transportation business comprised of a singular vessel, they began to expand and added more employees and vessels to their company across many decades. Today, CMA-CGM operates in over 100 countries, providing a powerful method of overseas transportation to many places around the world.

            But that stuff was all super boring, didn't care. More importantly, various teams at the corporation have been actively developing a Smartship, which utilizes all kinds of technology to help its crews better understand patterns in their onboard activities and the ship's maintenance needs. These are all done through cloud computing. Basically, any metrics deemed as valuable are actively tracked, with collected data being uploaded directly to the cloud from the ship itself. Various algorithms and data analysts then sort, organize, and study the data to better determine patterns. To help reduce their own carbon emissions, for example, their system keeps track of their fuel expenditure and which engines are and should be running to better optimize fuel consumption. They also use this data to determine when ships should be temporarily decommisioned for maintenance and cleaning. Overall, I found their application of cloud computing to be highly relevant to many of the topics we discussed in this course, and believe this acts as a good real-life use case.

            While some details were left out by the speakers due to time constraints, some interesting points of discussion regarding their use of cloud computing technology include whether or not they utilize an edge computing model for their data analysis or if they instead upload all data straight to the cloud. Questions regarding the kinds of cloud services they use, along with any major requirements or challenges they had to overcome to integrate their systems into the cloud also come to mind. The speakers also briefly touched upon industry and legal requirements, which was a concept we lightly explored throughout this course. Questions about how those impacted their Smartship also interested me.
